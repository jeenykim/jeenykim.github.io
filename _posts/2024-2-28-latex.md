## LaTex수식
### First example

The well-known Pythagorean theorem $\(x^2 + y^2 = z^2\)$ was proved to be invalid for other exponents, meaning the next equation has no integer solutions for \(n>2\):

$\[ x^n + y^n = z^n \]$

### Second example

We write integrals using $\int$ and fractions using $\frac{a}{b}$. Limits are placed on integrals using superscripts and subscripts:

$\[ \int_0^1 \frac{dx}{e^x} =  \frac{e-1}{e} \]$
